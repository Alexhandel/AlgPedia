The Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm is a polynomial time lattice reduction algorithm invented by Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra and László Lovász in 1982.[1] Given a basis

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =\{\mathbf {b} _{1},\mathbf {b} _{2},\dots ,\mathbf {b} _{d}\}}

 with n-dimensional integer coordinates, for a lattice L (a discrete subgroup of Rn) with 



 
d
≤
n


{\displaystyle \ d\leq n}

, the LLL algorithm calculates an LLL-reduced (short, nearly orthogonal) lattice basis in time
where B is the largest length of 




b

i




{\displaystyle b_{i}}

 under the Euclidean norm.
The original applications were to give polynomial-time algorithms for factorizing polynomials with rational coefficients, for finding simultaneous rational approximations to real numbers, and for solving the integer linear programming problem in fixed dimensions.


The precise definition of LLL-reduced is as follows: Given a basis
define its Gram–Schmidt process orthogonal basis
and the Gram-Schmidt coefficients
Then the basis 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is LLL-reduced if there exists a parameter 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 in (0.25,1] such that the following holds:
Here, estimating the value of the 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 parameter, we can conclude how well the basis is reduced. Greater values of 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 lead to stronger reductions of the basis. Initially, A. Lenstra, H. Lenstra and L. Lovász demonstrated the LLL-reduction algorithm for 



δ
=


3
4




{\displaystyle \delta ={\frac {3}{4}}}

. Note that although LLL-reduction is well-defined for 



δ
=
1


{\displaystyle \delta =1}

, the polynomial-time complexity is guaranteed only for 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 in (0.25,1).
The LLL algorithm computes LLL-reduced bases. There is no known efficient algorithm to compute a basis in which the basis vectors are as short as possible for lattices of dimensions greater than 4.[citation needed] However, an LLL-reduced basis is nearly as short as possible, in the sense that there are absolute bounds 




c

i


>
1


{\displaystyle c_{i}>1}

 such that the first basis vector is no more than 




c

1




{\displaystyle c_{1}}

 times as long as a shortest vector in the lattice, the second basis vector is likewise within 




c

2




{\displaystyle c_{2}}

 of the second successive minimum, and so on.
The following description is based on (Hoffstein, Pipher & Silverman 2008, Theorem 6.68), with the corrections from the errata [2]

LLL reduced basis
The LLL algorithm has found numerous other applications in MIMO detection algorithms [4] and cryptanalysis of public-key encryption schemes: knapsack cryptosystems, RSA with particular settings, NTRUEncrypt, and so forth. The algorithm can be used to find integer solutions to many problems.[5]
In particular, the LLL algorithm forms a core of one of the integer relation algorithms. For example, if it is believed that r=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) root to an unknown quadratic equation with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in

 and 



[

{\displaystyle [0,0,1,10000]}

. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer linear combination of these three, thus necessarily of the form

{\displaystyle ar^{2}+br+c}

 is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic polynomial which has r as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed
