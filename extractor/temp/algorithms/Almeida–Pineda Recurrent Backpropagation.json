    "full_text": "Almeida\u2013Pineda recurrent backpropagation is an extension to the backpropagation algorithm that is applicable to recurrent neural networks. It is a type of supervised learning.\nA recurrent neural network for this algorithm consists of some input units, some output units and eventually some hidden units.\nFor a given set of (input, target) states, the network is trained to settle into a stable activation state with the output units in the target state, based on a given input state clamped on the input units.\n",
