    "full_text": "In algebraic combinatorics, a Bender\u2013Knuth involution is an involution on the set of semistandard tableaux, introduced by Bender & Knuth (1972, pp.\u00a046\u201347) in their study of plane partitions.\nThe Bender\u2013Knuth involutions \u03c3k are defined for integers k, and act on the set of semistandard skew Young tableaux of some fixed shape \u03bc/\u03bd, where \u03bc and \u03bd are partitions. It acts by changing some of the elements k of the tableau to k\u00a0+\u00a01, and some of the entries k\u00a0+\u00a01 to k, in such a way that the numbers of elements with values k or k\u00a0+\u00a01 are exchanged. Call an entry of the tableau free if it is k or k\u00a0+\u00a01 and there is no other element with value k or k\u00a0+\u00a01 in the same column. For any i, the free entries of row i are all in consecutive columns, and consist of ai copies of k followed by bi copies of k\u00a0+\u00a01, for some ai and bi. The Bender\u2013Knuth involution \u03c3k replaces them by bi copies of k followed by ai copies of k\u00a0+\u00a01.\nBender\u2013Knuth involutions can be used to show that the number of semistandard skew tableaux of given shape and weight is unchanged under permutations of the weight. In turn this implies that the Schur function of a partition is a symmetric function.\nBender\u2013Knuth involutions were used by Stembridge (2002) to give a short proof of the Littlewood\u2013Richardson rule.",
