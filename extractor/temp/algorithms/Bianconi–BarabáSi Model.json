This model can explain that nodes with different characteristics acquire links at different rates. It predicts that a node's growth depends on its fitness and can calculate the degree distribution. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model is named after its inventors Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si. This model is a variant of the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model.\n\n\nThe Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) model uses two concepts: growth and preferential attachment. Here, growth indicates the increase in the number of nodes in the network with time, and preferential attachment means that more connected nodes receive more links. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model, on top of these two concepts, uses another new concept called the fitness. This model makes use of an analogy with evolutionary models. It assigns an intrinsic fitness value to each node, which embodies all the properties other than the degree.[1] The higher the fitness, the higher the probability of attracting new edges. Fitness can be defined as the ability to attract new links \u2013 \"a quantitative measure of a node's ability to stay in front of the competition\".[2]\nWhile the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) model explains the \"first mover advantage\" phenomenon, the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model explains how latecomers also can win. In a network where fitness is an attribute, a node with higher fitness will acquire links at a higher rate than less fit nodes. This model explains that age is not the best predictor of a node's success, rather latecomers also have the chance to attract links to become a hub.\nThe Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model can reproduce the degree correlations of the Internet Autonomous Systems.[3] This model can also show condensation phase transitions in the evolution of complex network.[4][5]\nWhile the BA model is useful in growing networks, the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model also works in case of static networks where the number of nodes is fixed.[6] The BB model can predict the topological properties of Internet.[7]\nThe fitness network begins with a fixed number of interconnected nodes. They have different fitness, which can be described with fitness parameter, \n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta _{j}}\n\n which is chosen from a fitness distribution\u00a0\u03c1(\u03b7).\nThe assumption here is that a node\u2019s fitness is independent of time, and is fixed. A new node j with m links and a fitness \n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta _{j}}\n\n is added with each time-step.\nThe probability \u03a0i that a new node connects to one of the existing links to a node i in the network depends on the number of edges, \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n\n, and on the fitness \n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta _{i}}\n\n of node i, such that,\nEach node\u2019s evolution with time can be predicted using the continuum theory. If initial number of node is m, then the degree of node i changes at the rate:\nAssuming the evolution of \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n\n follows a power law with a fitness exponent \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n(\n\n\u03b7\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta (\\eta _{i})}\n\n\nHere, \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n(\n\u03b7\n)\n=\n\n\n\u03b7\nC\n\n\n\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n\nC\n=\n\u222b\n\u03c1\n(\n\u03b7\n)\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n(\n\u03b7\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\u03b7\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta (\\eta )={\\frac {\\eta }{C}}{\\text{ and }}C=\\int \\rho (\\eta ){\\frac {\\eta }{1-\\beta (\\eta )}}\\,d\\eta .}\n\n\nIf all fitnesses are equal in a fitness network, the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model reduces to the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model.\nWhen fitnesses are equal, the probability \n\n\n\nP\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Pi_{i}}\n\n that the new node is connected to node \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n when \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n\n is the degree of node \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n is,\nDegree distribution of the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model depends on the fitness distribution \u03c1(\u03b7). There are two scenarios that can happen based on the probability distribution. If the fitness distribution has a finite domain, then the degree distribution will have a power-law just like the BA model. In the second case, if the fitness distribution has an infinite domain, then the node with the highest fitness value will attract a large number of nodes and show a winners-take-all scenario.[8] As the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model does not always show the power-law distribution, it has certain advantages such that this model can be used in non-heterogeneous networks such as World Trade Web.[9]\nIn 1999, Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si requested his student Bianconi to investigate evolving networks where nodes have a fitness parameter. Barab\u00e1si was interested in finding out how Google, a latecomer in the search engine market, became a top player. Google\u2019s toppling of previous top search engines went against Barab\u00e1si's BA model, which states that first mover has an advantage. In the scale-free network if a node appears first it will be most connected because it had the longest time to attract links. Bianconi's work showed that when fitness parameter is present, the \"early bird\" is not always the winner.[10] Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si's research showed that fitness is what creates or breaks the hub. Google's superior PageRank algorithm helped them to beat other top players. Later on Facebook came and dethroned Google as Internet's most linked website. In all these cases fitness mattered which was first showed in Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si's research. In 2001, Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si published the model in the Europhysics Letters.[11] In another paper,[12] substituting fitness for energy, nodes for energy level and links for particles, Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si was able to map the fitness model with Bose gas.",
