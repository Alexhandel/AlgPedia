A mixed approach is required in time\u2013frequency analysis techniques which are especially effective in analyzing non-stationary signals, whose frequency distribution and magnitude vary with time. Examples of these are acoustic signals. Classes of \"quadratic time-frequency distributions\" (or bilinear time\u2013frequency distributions\") are used for time\u2013frequency signal analysis. This class is similar in formulation to Cohen's class distribution function that was used in 1966 in the context of quantum mechanics. This distribution function is mathematically similar to a generalized time\u2013frequency representation which utilizes bilinear transformations. Compared with other time\u2013frequency analysis techniques, such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the bilinear-transformation (or quadratic time\u2013frequency distributions) may not have higher clarity for most practical signals, but it provides an alternative framework to investigate new definitions and new methods. While it does suffer from an inherent cross-term contamination when analyzing multi-component signals, by using a carefully chosen window function(s), the interference can be significantly mitigated, at the expense of resolution. All these bilinear distributions are inter-convertible to each other, cf. transformation between distributions in time\u2013frequency analysis.\nThe Wigner\u2013Ville distribution is a quadratic form that measures a local time-frequency energy given by:\nThe Wigner\u2013Ville distribution remains real as it is the fourier transform of f(u\u00a0+\u00a0\u03c4/2)\u00b7f*(u\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03c4/2), which has Hermitian symmetry in \u03c4. It can also be written as a frequency integration by applying the Parseval formula:\nLet \n\n\n\nf\n=\n\nf\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\nf\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f=f_{1}+f_{2}}\n\n be a composite signal. We can then write,\nwhere\nis the cross Wigner\u2013Ville distribution of two signals. The interference term\nis a real function that creates non-zero values at unexpected locations(close to the origin) in the \n\n\n\n(\nu\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (u,\\xi )}\n\n plane. Interference terms present in a real signal can be avoided by computing the analytic part \n\n\n\n\nf\n\na\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{a}(t)}\n\n.\nThe interference terms are oscillatory since the marginal integrals vanish and can be partially removed by smoothing \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}f}\n\n with a kernel\u00a0\u03b8\nThe time-frequency resolution of this distribution depends on the spread of kernel \u03b8 in the neighborhood of \n\n\n\n(\nu\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (u,\\xi )}\n\n. Since the interferences take negative values, one can guarantee that all interferences are removed by imposing that\nThe spectrogram and scalogram are examples of positive time-frequency energy distributions.

The resulting time-frequency energy density is\nFrom the Moyal formula,\nwhich is the time frequency averaging of a Wigner\u2013Ville distribution. The smoothing kernel thus can be written as\nThe loss of time-frequency resolution depends on the spread of the distribution \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\u03b3\n(\nu\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n(\n\nu\n\u2032\n\n,\n\n\u03be\n\u2032\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}\\phi _{\\gamma (u,\\xi )}(u',\\xi ')}\n\n in the neighborhood of \n\n\n\n(\nu\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (u,\\xi )}\n\n.\nA spectrogram computed with windowed fourier atoms,\nFor a spectrogram, the Wigner\u2013Ville averaging is therefore a 2-dimensional convolution with \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}g}\n\n. If g is a Gaussian window,\n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}g}\n\n is a 2-dimensional Gaussian. This proves that averaging \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}f}\n\n with a sufficiently wide Gaussian defines positive energy density. The general class of time-frequency distributions obtained by convolving \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{V}f}\n\n with an arbitrary kernel \u03b8 is called a Cohen's class, discussed below.\nWigner Theorem. There is no positive quadratic energy distribution Pf that satisfies the following time and frequency marginal integrals:\nThe definition of Cohen's class of bilinear (or quadratic) time\u2013frequency distributions is as follows:\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nx\n\n\n(\n\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{x}(\\eta ,\\tau )}\n\n is the ambiguity function (AF), which will be discussed later; and \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n(\n\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Phi (\\eta ,\\tau )}\n\n is Cohen's kernel function, which is often a low-pass function, and normally serves to mask out the interference in the original Wigner representation, \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\u2261\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Phi \\equiv 1}\n\n.\nAn equivalent definition relies on a convolution of the Wigner distribution function (WD) instead of the AF\u00a0:\nwhere the kernel function \n\n\n\n\u03a0\n(\nt\n,\nf\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pi (t,f)}\n\n is defined in the time-frequency domain instead of the ambiguity one. In the original Wigner representation, \n\n\n\n\u03a0\n=\n\n\u03b4\n\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pi =\\delta _{(0,0)}}\n\n. The relationship between the two kernels is the same as the one between the WD and the AF, namely two successive Fourier transforms (cf. diagram).\ni.e.\nor equivalently\nThe class of bilinear (or quadratic) time\u2013frequency distributions can be most easily understood in terms of the ambiguity function, an explanation of which follows.\nConsider the well known power spectral density \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nx\n\n\n(\nf\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{x}(f)}\n\n and the signal auto-correlation function \n\n\n\n\nR\n\nx\n\n\n(\n\u03c4\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{x}(\\tau )}\n\n in the case of a stationary process. The relationship between these functions is as follows:\nFor a non-stationary signal \n\n\n\nx\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x(t)}\n\n, these relations can be generalized using a time-dependent power spectral density or equivalently the famous Wigner distribution function of \n\n\n\nx\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x(t)}\n\n as follows:\nIf the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function is taken with respect to t instead of \u03c4, we get the ambiguity function as follows:\nThe relationship between the Wigner distribution function, the auto-correlation function and the ambiguity function can then be illustrated by the following figure.\nBy comparing the definition of bilinear (or quadratic) time\u2013frequency distributions with that of the Wigner distribution function, it is easily found that the latter is a special case of the former with \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n(\n\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Phi (\\eta ,\\tau )=1}\n\n. Alternatively, bilinear (or quadratic) time\u2013frequency distributions can be regarded as a masked version of the Wigner distribution function if a kernel function \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n(\n\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n\u2260\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Phi (\\eta ,\\tau )\\neq 1}\n\n is chosen. A properly chosen kernel function can significantly reduce the undesirable cross-term of the Wigner distribution function.\nWhat is the benefit of the additional kernel function? The following figure shows the distribution of the auto-term and the cross-term of a multi-component signal in both the ambiguity and the Wigner distribution function.\nFor multi-component signals in general, the distribution of its auto-term and cross-term within its Wigner distribution function is generally not predictable, and hence the cross-term cannot be removed easily. However, as shown in the figure, for the ambiguity function, the auto-term of the multi-component signal will inherently tend to close the origin in the \u03b7\u03c4-plane, and the cross-term will tend to be away from the origin. With this property, the cross-term in can be filtered out effortlessly if a proper low-pass kernel function is applied in \u03b7\u03c4-domain. The following is an example that demonstrates how the cross-term is filtered out.\nThe Fourier transform of \n\n\n\n\u03b8\n(\nu\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta (u,\\xi )}\n\n is\nThe following proposition gives necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that \n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{\\theta }}\n\n satisfies marginal energy properties like those of the Wigner\u2013Ville distribution.\nAforementioned, the Wigner distribution function is a member of the class of quadratic time-frequency distributions (QTFDs) with the kernel function \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n(\n\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Phi (\\eta ,\\tau )=1}\n\n. The definition of Wigner distribution is as follows:\nWe can design time-frequency energy distributions that satisfy the scaling property\nas does the Wigner\u2013Ville distribution. If\nthen\nThis is equivalent to imposing that\nand hence\nThe Rihaczek and Choi\u2013Williams distributions are examples of affine invariant Cohen's class distributions.\nThe kernel of Choi\u2013Williams distribution is defined as follows:\nwhere \u03b1 is an adjustable parameter.\nThe kernel of Rihaczek distribution is defined as follows:\nWith this particular kernel a simple calculation proves that\nThe kernel of cone-shape distribution function is defined as follows:\nwhere \u03b1 is an adjustable parameter. See Transformation between distributions in time-frequency analysis. More such QTFDs and a full list can be found in, e.g., Cohen's text cited.\nA time-varying spectrum for non-stationary processes is defined from the expected Wigner\u2013Ville distribution. Locally stationary processes appear in many physical systems where random fluctuations are produced by a mechanism that changes slowly in time. Such processes can be approximated locally by a stationary process.
