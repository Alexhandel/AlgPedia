    "full_text": "The Brams\u2013Taylor\u2013Zwicker procedure is a protocol for envy-free cake-cutting among 4 partners.[1]:126\u2013128\nThe procedure uses a variation of Austin's procedure for two partners and general fractions. That procedure allows two partners to divide an entire cake to \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n pieces, each of which is worth exactly \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/k}\n\n for both of them.\nThe main procedure works as follows.\nA. Use Austin's procedure with \n\n\n\nk\n=\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=4}\n\n and partners #1 and #2. So we have 4 pieces that the first two partners believe to be of exactly identical value of 1/4.\nB. Partner #3 trims one piece to create a two-way tie for the largest; the partners now choose pieces in reverse order (#4, #3, #2, #1). Either #4 or #3 must take the trimmed piece. This creates an envy-free division for the entire cake less the trimmings (This is similar to the Selfridge\u2013Conway discrete procedure).\nC. Now the trimmings are divided. Assume w.l.o.g. that #3 took the trimmed piece. We use Austin's procedure again with the trimmings and partners #4 and #1, to create 4 pieces each of which equals exactly 1/4 for both of them. Since partners #1 and #2 have an irrevocable advantage over whoever partner that took the trimmed piece, we can let #3 be the first to select a piece from the trimming, then #2, then #4 and #1.\nThe run-time of the procedure is, technically, infinite, since Austin's procedure involves two knives moving continuously, and this procedure cannot be discretized.\nThe number of cuts is bounded, though. Austin's procedure requires 2 cuts to divide a cake between 2 people with an exact value of 1/2; each of these pieces should be divided with 2 more cuts to generate the 4 pieces with exact value of 1/4. So in total, 6 cuts are needed for step A. A single cut is done in step B and 6 more cuts in step C, for a total of 13 cuts.\nAn advanced variant of the Brams\u2013Taylor\u2013Zwicker procedure uses only 11 cuts.[2]",
