This update maintains the symmetry and positive definiteness of the Hessian matrix.\nGiven a function \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n, its gradient (\n\n\n\n\u2207\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nabla f}\n\n), and positive definite Hessian matrix \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n, the Taylor series is:\nand the Taylor series of the gradient itself (secant equation):\nis used to update \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n.
