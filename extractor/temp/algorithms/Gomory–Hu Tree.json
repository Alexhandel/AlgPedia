Goldberg and K. Tsioutsiouliklis implemented the Gomory-Hu algorithm and Gusfield algorithm. Experimental results comparing these algorithms are reported in[2] Source code is available here.\nCohen et al.[3] reports results on two parallel implementations of Gusfield's algorithm using OpenMP and MPI, respectively. Source code of these implementations is available here: Parallel Cut Tree Algorithms Page. (broken link)\nThe Gomory\u2013Hu tree was introduced by R. E. Gomory and T. C. Hu in 1961.\nIn planar graphs, the Gomory\u2013Hu tree is dual to the minimum weight cycle basis, in the sense that the cuts of the Gomory\u2013Hu tree are dual to a collection of cycles in the dual graph that form a minimum-weight cycle basis.[4]",
