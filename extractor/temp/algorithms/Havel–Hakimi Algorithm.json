    "full_text": "The Havel\u2013Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory solving the graph realization problem, i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integers a simple graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integers is called graphic. The algorithm constructs a special solution if one exists or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was published by Havel (1955), and later by Hakimi (1962).\nThe algorithm is based on the following theorem.\nLet \n\n\n\nS\n=\n(\n\nd\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nd\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=(d_{1},\\dots ,d_{n})}\n\n be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is nonincreasing. List \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n is graphic if and only if the finite list \n\n\n\n\nS\n\u2032\n\n=\n(\n\nd\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n,\n\nd\n\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nd\n\n\nd\n\n1\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n,\n\nd\n\n\nd\n\n1\n\n\n+\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nd\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S'=(d_{2}-1,d_{3}-1,\\dots ,d_{d_{1}+1}-1,d_{d_{1}+2},\\dots ,d_{n})}\n\n has nonnegative integers and is graphic.\nIf the given list \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n graphic then the theorem will be applied at most \n\n\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n-1}\n\n times setting in each further step \n\n\n\nS\n:=\n\nS\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S:=S'}\n\n. Note that it can be necessary to sort this list again. This process ends when the whole list \n\n\n\n\nS\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S'}\n\n consists of zeros. In each step of the algorithm one constructs the edges of a graph with vertices \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\nv\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{1},\\cdots ,v_{n}}\n\n, i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n to \n\n\n\n\nS\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S'}\n\n, then we add edges \n\n\n\n{\n\nv\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n}\n,\n{\n\nv\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nv\n\n3\n\n\n}\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n{\n\nv\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nv\n\n\nd\n\n1\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{v_{1},v_{2}\\},\\{v_{1},v_{3}\\},\\cdots ,\\{v_{1},v_{d_{1}+1}\\}}\n\n. When the list \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n cannot be reduced to a list \n\n\n\n\nS\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S'}\n\n of nonnegative integers in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n from the beginning is not graphic.",
