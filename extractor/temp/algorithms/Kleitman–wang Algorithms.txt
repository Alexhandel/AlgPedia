ABOUT
The Kleitman–Wang algorithms are two different algorithms in graph theory solving the digraph realization problem, i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integer pairs a simple directed graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integer pairs is called digraphic. Both algorithms construct a special solution if one exists or prove that one cannot find a positive answer. These constructions are based on recursive algorithms. Kleitman and Wang [1] gave these algorithms in 1973.

The Kleitman–Wang algorithms are two different algorithms in graph theory solving the digraph realization problem, i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integer pairs a simple directed graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integer pairs is called digraphic. Both algorithms construct a special solution if one exists or prove that one cannot find a positive answer. These constructions are based on recursive algorithms. Kleitman and Wang [1] gave these algorithms in 1973.


The algorithm is based on the following theorem.
Let 



S
=
(
(

a

1


,

b

1


)
,
…
,
(

a

n


,

b

n


)
)


{\displaystyle S=((a_{1},b_{1}),\dots ,(a_{n},b_{n}))}

 be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is in nonincreasing lexicographical order and let 



(

a

i


,

b

i


)


{\displaystyle (a_{i},b_{i})}

 be a pair of nonnegative integers with 




b

i


>
0


{\displaystyle b_{i}>0}

. List 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 is digraphic if and only if the finite list 




S
′

=
(
(

a

,

b

,

b


b

i


+

)
,
…
,
(

a

n


,

b

n


)
)


{\displaystyle S'=((a_{1}-1,b_{1}),\dots ,(a_{b_{i}-1}-1,b_{b_{i}-1}),(a_{b_{i}},0),(a_{b_{i}+1},b_{b_{i}+1}),(a_{b_{i}+2},b_{b_{i}+2}),\dots ,(a_{n},b_{n}))}

 has nonnegative integer pairs and is digraphic.
Note that the pair 



(

a

i


,

b

i


)


{\displaystyle (a_{i},b_{i})}

 is arbitrarily with the exception of pairs 



(

a

j


,
0
)


{\displaystyle (a_{j},0)}

. If the given list 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 digraphic then the theorem will be applied at most 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 times setting in each further step 



S
:=

S
′



{\displaystyle S:=S'}

. This process ends when the whole list 




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}

 consists of 



(
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (0,0)}

 pairs. In each step of the algorithm one constructs the arcs of a digraph with vertices 




v

1


,
…
,

v

n




{\displaystyle v_{1},\dots ,v_{n}}

, i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 to 




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}

, then we add arcs 



(

v

i


,

v

1


)
,
(

v

i


,

v

2


)
,
…
,
(

v

,

+
1


)


{\displaystyle (v_{i},v_{1}),(v_{i},v_{2}),\dots ,(v_{i},v_{b_{i}-1}),(v_{i},v_{b_{i}+1})}

. When the list 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 cannot be reduced to a list 




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}

 of nonnegative integer pairs in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 from the beginning is not digraphic.
The algorithm is based on the following theorem.
Let

=
(

 has nonnegative integer pairs and is digraphic.
Note that the list
