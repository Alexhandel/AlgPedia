After that, the whole procedure is restarted.\nConsider, as before, a polynomial with complex coefficients\nDenote the reverse conjugate polynomial as \n\n\n\n\np\n\n\u2217\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n=\n\nz\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\u00af\n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n)\n=\n\nz\n\nn\n\n\n\n\np\n\u00af\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nz\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p^{*}(z)=z^{n}{\\bar {p}}(z^{-1})=z^{n}{\\overline {p}}({\\bar {z}}^{-1})}\n\n.

For each quarter, the image of the boundary is a curve in the complex plane. The argument principle is then applied to this path to find the winding number about the origin. Given that the function is analytic within each of these quarters, a nonzero winding number N (always an integer) identifies N zeros of the function inside the quarter in question by Rouch\u00e9's theorem, each zero counted as many times as its multiplicity.\nAnalogously with the bisection method, the algorithm is then applied recursively to any quarter whose boundary has nonzero winding number to further refine the estimates of the zeros. The recursion is repeated until the zero-containing rectangles are either small enough that their centres give sufficiently accurate zero estimates or, alternatively, that another root-finding algorithm can be applied to the estimates to further refine them.",
