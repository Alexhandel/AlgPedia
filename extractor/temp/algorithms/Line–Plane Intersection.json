Distinguishing these cases, and determining equations for the point and line in the latter cases, have use in computer graphics, motion planning, and collision detection.\n\n\nIn vector notation, a plane can be expressed as the set of points \n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} }\n\n for which\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {n} }\n\n is a normal vector to the plane and \n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p_{0}} }\n\n is a point on the plane.
