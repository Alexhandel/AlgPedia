    "about": "In mathematics, the Odlyzko\u2013Sch\u00f6nhage algorithm is a fast algorithm for evaluating the Riemann zeta function at many points, introduced by (Odlyzko & Sch\u00f6nhage\u00a01988). The main point is the use of the fast Fourier transform to speed up the evaluation of a finite Dirichlet series of length N at O(N) equally spaced values from O(N2) to O(N1+\u03b5) steps (at the cost of storing O(N1+\u03b5) intermediate values). The Riemann\u2013Siegel formula used for calculating the Riemann zeta function with imaginary part T uses a finite Dirichlet series with about N = T1/2 terms, so when finding about N values of the Riemann zeta function it is sped up by a factor of about T1/2. This reduces the time to find the zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part at most T from about T3/2+\u03b5 steps to about T1+\u03b5 steps.",
