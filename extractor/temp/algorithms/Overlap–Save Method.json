Consider a segment that begins at n = kL\u00a0+\u00a0M, for any integer k, and define:\nThen, for kL\u00a0+\u00a0M \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 n \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 kL\u00a0+\u00a0L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, and equivalently M \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0kL \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, we can write:\nThe task is thereby reduced to computing yk[n], for M \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 n \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. The process described above is illustrated in the accompanying figure.\nNow note that if we periodically extend xk[n] with period N \u00a0\u2265\u00a0 L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, according to:\nthe convolutions \u00a0\n\n\n\n(\n\nx\n\nk\n,\nN\n\n\n)\n\u2217\nh\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (x_{k,N})*h\\,}\n\n\u00a0 and \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nk\n\n\n\u2217\nh\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{k}*h\\,}\n\n\u00a0 are equivalent in the region M \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 n \u00a0\u2264\u00a0 L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. So it is sufficient to compute the N-point circular (or cyclic) convolution of \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nk\n\n\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{k}[n]\\,}\n\n with \n\n\n\nh\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h[n]\\,}\n\n\u00a0 in the region [1,\u00a0N]. \u00a0The subregion [M,\u00a0L\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01] is appended to the output stream, and the other values are discarded.\nThe advantage is that the circular convolution can be computed very efficiently as follows, according to the circular convolution theorem:\nwhere:\n\n\nWhen the DFT and its inverse is implemented by the FFT algorithm, the pseudocode above requires about N log2(N) + N complex multiplications for the FFT, product of arrays, and IFFT.[note 1] Each iteration produces N-M+1 output samples, so the number of complex multiplications per output sample is about:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\nlog\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\nN\n)\n+\nN\n\n\nN\n\u2212\nM\n+\n1\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {N\\log _{2}(N)+N}{N-M+1}}.\\,}\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Eq.2)\nFor example, when M=201 and N=1024, Eq.2 equals 13.67, whereas direct evaluation of Eq.1 would require up to 201 complex multiplications per output sample, the worst case being when both x and h are complex-valued. Also note that for any given M, Eq.2 has a minimum with respect to N. It diverges for both small and large block sizes.\nOverlap\u2013discard[1] and Overlap\u2013scrap[2] are less commonly used labels for the same method described here. However, these labels are actually better (than overlap\u2013save) to distinguish from overlap\u2013add, because both methods \"save\", but only one discards. \"Save\" merely refers to the fact that M\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 input (or output) samples from segment k are needed to process segment k + 1.\nThe overlap-save algorithm may be extended to include other common operations of a system:[note 2][3]",
