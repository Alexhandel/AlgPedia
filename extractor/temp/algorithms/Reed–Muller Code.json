The remaining RM codes may be constructed from these elementary codes using the length-doubling construction\nFrom this construction, RM(r,m) is a binary linear block code (n, k, d) with length n\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0m, dimension \n\n\n\nk\n(\nr\n,\nm\n)\n=\nk\n(\nr\n,\nm\n\u2212\n1\n)\n+\nk\n(\nr\n\u2212\n1\n,\nm\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k(r,m)=k(r,m-1)+k(r-1,m-1)}\n\n and minimum distance \n\n\n\nd\n=\n\n2\n\nm\n\u2212\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d=2^{m-r}}\n\n for \n\n\n\nr\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r\\geq 0}\n\n. The dual code to RM(r,m) is RM(m-r-1,m). This shows that repetition and SPC codes are duals, biorthogonal and extended Hamming codes are duals and that codes with k\u00a0=\u00a0n/2 are self-dual.\nThere is another, simple way to construct Reed\u2013Muller codes based on low-degree polynomials over a finite field. This construction is particularly suited for their application as locally testable codes and locally decodable codes.[2]\nLet \n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} }\n\n be a finite field and let \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n be positive integers, where \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n should be thought of as larger than \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n.

The basic idea of majority logic decoding is to build several checksums for each received code word element. Since each of the different checksums must all have the same value (i.e. the value of the message word element weight), we can use a majority logic decoding to decipher the value of the message word element. Once each order of the polynomial is decoded, the received word is modified accordingly by removing the corresponding codewords weighted by the decoded message contributions, up to the present stage. So for a rth order RM code, we have to decode iteratively r+1, times before we arrive at the final received code-word. Also, the values of the message bits are calculated through this scheme; finally we can calculate the codeword by multiplying the message word (just decoded) with the generator matrix.\nOne clue if the decoding succeeded, is to have an all-zero modified received word, at the end of (r\u00a0+\u00a01)-stage decoding through the majority logic decoding. This technique was proposed by Irving S. Reed, and is more general when applied to other finite geometry codes.\nResearch Articles:\nTextbooks:",
