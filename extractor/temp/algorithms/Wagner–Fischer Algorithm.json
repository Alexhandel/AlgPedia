    "full_text": "In computer science, the Wagner\u2013Fischer algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the edit distance between two strings of characters.\n\n\nThe Wagner\u2013Fischer algorithm has a history of multiple invention. Navarro lists the following inventors of it, with date of publication, and acknowledges that the list is incomplete:[1]:43\nThe Wagner\u2013Fischer algorithm computes edit distance based on the observation that if we reserve a matrix to hold the edit distances between all prefixes of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix by flood filling the matrix, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed.\nA straightforward implementation, as pseudocode for a function EditDistance that takes two strings, s of length m, and t of length n, and returns the Levenshtein distance between them, looks as follows. Note that the input strings are one-indexed, while the matrix d is zero-indexed, and [i..k] is a closed range.\nTwo examples of the resulting matrix (hovering over an underlined number reveals the operation performed to get that number):\nThe invariant maintained throughout the algorithm is that we can transform the initial segment s[1..i] into t[1..j] using a minimum of d[i,j] operations. At the end, the bottom-right element of the array contains the answer.\nAs mentioned earlier, the invariant is that we can transform the initial segment s[1..i] into t[1..j] using a minimum of d[i,j] operations. This invariant holds since:\nThis proof fails to validate that the number placed in d[i,j] is in fact minimal; this is more difficult to show, and involves an argument by contradiction in which we assume d[i,j] is smaller than the minimum of the three, and use this to show one of the three is not minimal.\nPossible modifications to this algorithm include:\nBy initializing the first row of the matrix with zeros, we obtain a variant of the Wagner\u2013Fischer algorithm that can be used for fuzzy string search of a string in a text.[1] This modification gives the end-position of matching substrings of the text. To determine the start-position of the matching substrings, the number of insertions and deletions can be stored separately and used to compute the start-position from the end-position.[4]\nThe resulting algorithm is by no means efficient, but was at the time of its publication (1980) one of the first algorithms that performed approximate search.[1]",
