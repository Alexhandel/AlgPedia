# Use this file as a basis for your local settings file.
# If you name it 'local.py', it will be used as the project's settings file automatically.
# If you use a different name or folder, set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable
# to point to it (in Python dotted format).

# Pick one of the base settings files below, and remove the other lines:
# from production import *  # @UnusedWildImport
# from development import *  # @UnusedWildImport


# URL settings (optional).
# HOST_NAME = 'myhostname.orama.com.br'  # Only change if your instance uses a hostname different than 'localhost'.

# Database settings (required for all instances).
# DATABASES = db_config(main_schema, cep_schema, ambima_schema, username, password, host)

# Email settings (required for development instances).
# DETOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'My Name <my.name@orama.com.br>'  # Developer instances should set the catch-all address to avoid having mail sent to the whole development team.

# Add other local settings here as required.
